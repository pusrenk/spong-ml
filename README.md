##starting info

to push to repo you will need an approval from one of the member to push your changes, also the changes will need to come from the PR(pull request)

any changes that will be made need to come from a branch

eg. init struct then will require to create a new branch called initstruct (the naming isn't strictly like that, create one that align with your changes, suits yourself)

to create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b branchname
```

change the branchname to your real branch name


> [!CAUTION]
> don't forget to pull the latest changes from main branch to avoid conflicts
